							<p>Steen J. Brown was born and raised in Austin, Texas. As a young man, he attended Texas Tech University in the hopes of acquiring a Mechanical Engineering degree.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="grid_7 alpha omega attorneycontent">
							<p> After 2 years of studying engineering, he decided that engineering was not for him, and transferred to the University of Texas, at Austin, where he completed his BBA degree in the engineering route to business. He then proceeded to work in the family furniture business, eventually opening his own furniture stores, and did that work for 20 years. During and after that time, he developed, owned, and operated a manufacturing plant that manufactured advertising buttons in house. He was proud to say that the advertising buttons were manufactured using 100% American parts. </p>
						
						
						

							<p> All of his adult life, Attorney Brown has been a small business owner, and through his ventures discovered that his real interest was in the laws governing business, particularly small business. In the meantime, he received his MBA degree from Texas State University. <p>

							<p> Since the law kept creeping into his daily work, and he found that he had a serious interest in it, he decided to tackle law school. By this time, he had moved to Orlando, Florida, pursuing an internet marketing business, and rather than relocate, attended Barry University School of Law in Orlando. So it is with his business background, Attorney Brown takes a business approach to the law. And one of his passions is a concentration in helping small businesses protect themselves from liability. </p>
