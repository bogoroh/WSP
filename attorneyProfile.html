            <div class="grid_4 omega">
                <p>Steen J. Brown was born and raised in Austin, Texas. As a
                young man, he attended Texas Tech University in the hopes of
                acquiring a Mechanical Engineering degree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="grid_7 alpha omega attorneycon">
                <p>After 2 years of studying engineering, he decided that
                engineering was not for him, and transferred to the University
                of Texas, at Austin, where he completed his BBA degree in the
                engineering route to business. He then proceeded to work in the
                family furniture business, eventually opening his own furniture
                stores, and did that work for 20 years. During and after that
                time, he developed, owned, and operated a manufacturing plant
                that manufactured advertising buttons in house. He was proud to
                say that the advertising buttons were manufactured using 100%
                American parts.</p>

                <p>All of his adult life, Attorney Brown has been a small
                business owner, and through his ventures discovered that his
                real interest was in the laws governing business, particularly
                small business. In the meantime, he received his MBA degree
                from Texas State University.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p>Since the law kept creeping into his daily work, and he
                found that he had a serious interest in it, he decided to
                tackle law school. By this time, he had moved to Orlando,
                Florida, pursuing an internet marketing business, and rather
                than relocate, attended Barry University School of Law in
                Orlando. So it is with his business background, Attorney Brown
                takes a business approach to the law. And one of his passions
                is a concentration in helping small businesses protect
                themselves from liability.</p>
